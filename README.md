This is my first public project on this platform!

So, this is an edited ESP32-cam code with the addition of an OLED display function.

Connection diagram:

ESP32-cam (pin 14) = OLED (SDA)

ESP32-cam (pin 15) = OLED (SCL/SCK)

ESP32-cam (Vcc) = OLED (Vcc)

ESP32-cam (Gnd) = OLED (Gnd)

To get original code, in your Arduino IDE go to: File > Examples > ESP32 > Camera > CameraWebServer
